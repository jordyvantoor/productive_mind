I’ve always been obsessed with learning—finding ways to improve how I think, work, and collaborate. In my career, success isn’t just about technical skills; it’s about leadership, communication, and understanding people. That’s why I read books that help me develop these skills—books on strategy, feedback, decision-making, and personal effectiveness.

But reading isn’t enough. I started this blog as a way to process what I learn and share it with others who are also on a path of continuous improvement. I use AI tools to help me write these posts, not because I _need_ to, but because I _want_ to. AI fascinates me—not just as a technology, but as a tool that can make thinking, writing, and working more efficient. This blog is as much about personal development as it is about exploring how AI can enhance the way we learn and create.

What you won’t find here: personal details about my job or a focus on technical topics. What you will find: distilled insights from books that matter, practical takeaways, and an honest exploration of how AI fits into the learning process.

If you’re someone who values growth, efficiency, and new ways of thinking, I hope you’ll find something useful here. Let’s keep learning.
